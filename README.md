## Introduction
Do you have a car or are considering to purchase one? If so, would you choose a brand new car or used-car? Our research explores a question that most people will think for at least once in their life times: what factors most significantly affect the prices of used cars? This research question is vital as it directly impacts the decisionmaking process for countless individuals and businesses involved in the second-hand car market. We believe that the mileage of a used car, the year it was produced, and any price drop of the car from its initial price are the most influential factors of the price in which a used car is sold. To anchor our analysis, we have selected a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle that includes a variety of variables related to used cars. By examining key attributes such as mileage, production year, and price depreciation, we aim to identify the factors most significantly influencing used car prices, ultimately offering valuable insights for both consumers and businesses in the second-hand car market.
